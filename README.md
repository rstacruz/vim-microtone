# vim-microtone

I'm still working on this!

```vimscript
Plug "rstacruz/vim-microtone"
```

```vimscript
:color microtone
:set background=dark
:set background=light
```

## Variants

- `microtone` only supports 16-colour terminals (follows your terminal colour scheme, great with [pywal](https://github.com/richtan/pywal.vim)) and limited support for GUI colours (WIP)
- `microtone-16a` up to `16e` are different variations of the 16-colour theme. Some might look better depending on your terminal's theme
- `microtone-256` supports 256-colour terminals (WIP)
